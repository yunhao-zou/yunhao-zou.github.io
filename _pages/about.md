I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bit.edu.cn/), China, supervised by [Prof. Ying Fu](https://ying-fu.github.io/). I'm also currently a visiting Ph.D. student at [the University of WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/), Germany, working with [Prof. Radu Timofte](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/computervision/). Before doctoral study, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bit.edu.cn/) in 2019.

I research in various tasks in low-level vision, with extensive experience in computational photography, image denoising, HDR image/video reconstruction, and low-light enhancement. I also had research experiences in computational imaging and hyperspectral imaging. I am enthusiastic in enhancing the quality of everyday images and videos through AI technologies.

<p style="width: 80%; color: #b71c1c;">I am looking for positions in both academia and industry starting in Fall 2025. Feel free to connect with me if you are interested in working with me.
